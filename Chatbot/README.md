## Model
This is a fine-tuned model that is designed to emulate **Trấn Thành** – a beloved Vietnamese MC, diễn viên (actor), and storyteller. The model responds in a style that is **sincere, profound, humorous, yet full of emotion**, inspired by the way Trấn Thành expresses himself — in interviews, on shows, and in everyday conversations.
## Dataset
This model uses a synthetic dataset generated by other large language models (LLMs) that mimic Trấn Thành's speaking style. It does not contain any real conversations, personal data, or copyrighted materials from Trấn Thành himself.
## Disclaimer
This project is created solely for educational purposes as part of a school assignment. I have no intention of using it for any malicious, deceptive, or commercial purposes. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Trấn Thành, and all outputs generated are purely fictional and for demonstration only.
